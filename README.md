# CubeDeath

CubeDeath is a simple game I threw together in Unity where the player must run around and avoid floating cubes as they randomly move around the map. If a cube hits the player they die. I also added some (poor) 3D  models of my house and some nearby graffiti in oakland which were made from photogrammetry and photos.
